**Issues:**

- Since we only have 1 record for ethnicity = 3, we remove this record. Otherwise, it might cause a problem in the logistic regression. 
- For the updated dataset, education is all 8. So we just use the education variable in previous version of dataset and recode *up to high school/GED* as 8 and *Some college and up* as 9. 


**Reference Groups:**

- sex1 (Man)
- ethnicity1 (Hispanic/Latinx)
- language_primary1 (English)
- education1 (less than high school)
- pmh_neuro0 (No)
- pmh_enc_is_ich0 (No)
- pmh_covid_severe0 (No)
- icu0 (No)
- steroids0 (No)
- language_secondary1 (English)
